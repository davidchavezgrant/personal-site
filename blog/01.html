        <h1> January 3rd, 2023 </h1>
        <p> Today I actually deployed my website. I decided to do it using a simple static site with no framework. Just simple html files and static hosting on Cloudflare pages. </p>
        <p>I've been wanting to do this for a long time, and I don't know what's different about today that finally made me act on that desire.</p>
        <p>I'm writing all of this using vim (neovim to be exact) and technically, I have GitHub Copilot helping me, but I tend to ignore its suggesstions.</p>
        <p>In the age where it's so easy to make a "pretty" site using a library like React, why would you write your blog in manual, unstyled html? </p>
        <p>I ask in exchange -- why do I need React, or any library or framework for simple text on a web page? </p>
